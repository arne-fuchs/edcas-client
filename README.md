# Build it yourself

## Build Requirements

* Around 10 GB of disk space required
* <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install >Rust with cargo</a>

### Debian based

```bash
sudo apt install cmake cargo pkg-config libssl-dev libfontconfig1-dev libclang-dev openssl clang build-essential git libudev-dev libasound2-dev
```
### Arch

## Building

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arne-fuchs/edcas-client.git
```

cd into it and build it

```bash
cd edcas-client && cargo build
```

## Standard directories

Edcas will first look into some standard directories before falling back into the current directory.
It might try to copy the files to the desired places.

| File                       | Look-up                                  | Fallback                |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| settings-example.json      | /etc/edcas-client/settigns-example.json  | ./settings-example.json |
| settings.json              | $HOME/.config/edcas-client/settings.json | ./settings.json         |
| Assets like materials.json | /usr/share/edcas-client/                 | ./                      |
| logs                       | /tmp/edcas-client/                       | ./logs/                 |


## Using it with <a href=https://github.com/rfvgyhn/min-ed-launcher>min-ed-launcher</a>

Go and first build the project with
```bash
cargo build
```

Then edit your min-ed-launcher config:

```bash
nano ~/.config/min-ed-launcher/settings.json
```

and add this to your processes:

```json
"processes": [
        {
          "fileName": "/PATHTOEDCAS/edcas-client",
          "arguments": ""
        }
    ],
```

If you installed edcas-client over a package, you can find the binary in /usr/bin/edcas-client.
